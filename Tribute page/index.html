                <h2> Biography</h2>
                <p>Kim Nam-joon (Korean: 김남준; born September 12, 1994), known professionally as RM (formerly Rap Monster), is a South Korean rapper, songwriter and record producer. He is the leader of South Korean boy band BTS.</p>
                <p> RM selected the name "Rap Monster" during his time as an idol trainee. But he formally changed his stage name to "RM" in November 2017 during BTS' DNA era, as he felt that "Rap Monster" was no longer representative of who he was as a person.</p>

                <h2> Career</h2>
            <p>RM began his career as a rapper in middle school when he grew interested in lyricism. In 2007, as a first year middle school student, RM began rapping in local amateur hip-hop circles and then the underground k-hip-hop scene under the pseudonym 'Runch Rancha.' <br>
            <p>RM auditioned and joined BigHit Entertainment at the age of 16. A few years later, on August 20th,  2014, he went on to debut in BTS with their first studio album 'Dark and Wild.' In 2015, RM released his first solo-mixtape. Then in 2018, he released his most recent and second mixtape, 'Mono.' Since their debut, the group has released 9 studio albums together. <br>
            <p>As a student, RM had an IQ of 148 and scored in the top 1% of the nation in the university entrance examinations for language, math, foreign language and social studies.Because his parents had been strongly opposed to his interest in a musical career due to his academic achievements, RM initially decided to set music aside to focus on his studies. He eventually convinced his mother to allow him to be a rapper, asking her if "she wanted to have a son who was a first-place rapper, or a 5,000th-place student".</p>

            <p>In March 2019, after graduating from Global Cyber University with a degree in Broadcasting and Entertainment, RM enrolled at Hanyang Cyber University's Master of Business Administration program in Advertising and Media.</p>
